#1). because sometimes setImmediate is faster than setTimeout, this is because setTimeout is calling the function 
after delay has finished and after the event loop reached to Timer after checking all the other phases by their order. 
(eg. if the event loop was at I/O callbacks phase when time is over the event loop go through all the other phases and 
come back to Timer phase to send it to V8 engine). But, setImmediate puts callback function int the check phase, in this
if the event loop is working on other phases other than close callbacks phase it will be faster to get to check phase than 
Timer phase.  So it is faster.

#2) setImmediate queue the function in the check phase and depending on where the event loop is working it has to wait for a 
some time to bee executed in V8 until it reaches check phase . 

process.nextTick queue the function at nextTick queue , and it executes immediately after the current function completes.
